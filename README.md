# Mac compilation notes

##Lua

###Linking Lua
Add static linking to Lua library, by right-clicking in the .pro file. Choose **"Add External Library"** and browse to the \*.a file.
Change the inclue directory to the files with the source files.

###Add dynamic library
In order to prevent RANA from chrashing on launch due to a missing liblua52.dylip file do the following:
Goto Projects, in the side panel and follaw:
 Run > Run Environment > Add, then add **DYLD\_LIBRARY\_PATH**, and set it to the path of the liblua52.dylib file. 

You need to do this event if Lua is statically linked.
